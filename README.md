An Intra project which involves making a game similar to any tycoon game with the options to:

* spawn certain objects, 
* translate/rotate a selected object at will,
* save the state of the game and load them too
* spawn people and have them interact with objects
* pause, fast forward or record a scene and its interactions

Intra originally intended for this to be a group project between 3-5 people,
however I took on starting and completing this project alone.
